# Interview-Questions
Python3 solutions to some interview questions
I've been studying Python for Data Structures, Algorithms, and Interviews by Jose Portilla
and I tend to write my own solutions for the problems given in the course!
The goal is to keep the track of my code and also share the answers with people who may 
wanna take a look at a different solution than the one given in the course!
